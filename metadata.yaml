description: What would you do if you and a handful of other people were the only
  lucky ones to have survived an apocalyptic nightmare -- and half of your fellow
  survivors were your sworn enemies? That's the question at the center of Arthur Leo
  Zagat's tightly plotted short story, ""When the Sleepers Woke."" It's a science
  fiction gem that fans of the genre will surely appreciate.
